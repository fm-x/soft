  The JUDE/Community contains basic functions such as;
   * Support of Class, UseCase, StateMachine, Activity, Sequence, Communication
     Deployment and Component Diagrams based on UML1.4 Visualization of your
     software design.(Some part of Diagrams are supported on UML2.0)

   * The "world map view" enables you to capture a whole diagram and the
